                I forcefully stepped on the lowest foot pedal to strike the 18.5-ton bell — rounding off a cascading wall of sound carried on the wind to inadvertent listeners walking through the city and to the audience applauding 200 feet below. Consisting of 72 bronze bells with a combined weight of 100 tons, the carillon at Rockefeller Chapel in Chicago epitomizes many of the qualities that first attracted me to the instrument. The massive clappers need to be carefully controlled as they are brought into contact with the bells through a direct mechanical connection.

                The carillon is not only a nuanced musical instrument, but also a massive machine. I am a machinist and engineer at heart, and these tendencies, along with the creativity and curiosity I honed through musical studies, cultured my passion for innovation. The work of developing and training machine learning algorithms gives me a glimpse into the advantages that the tactful application of such tools could have in medicine. Radiology has long been the field of innovators, and the increased freedom from machine learning will only enhance that by permitting more time for research and clinical development. Deep learning is also revealing previously undetected information in imaging studies. However, I feel we must proceed with caution: it is no secret that algorithms can be tricked when the parameters diverge from those governing the training data. I hope to use my understanding of the processes involved in these systems and the radiologic expertise I will gain, to ensure that they are sufficiently validated and tested to avoid adverse outcomes for patients.

                Working in a state-of-the-art 3D printing lab has taught me that technologies can be useful even if not completely transformative. One of the models I printed was of a ventral abdominal wall hernia that, due to the quality of the CT scan used for segmentation, was suitable for little more than use as a doorstop. The Chief of Surgery, however, was thrilled about the way it illustrated the relationship between ribs and soft tissues. His patient wanted to take it home and place it on the fireplace mantle. I hope the adoption of 3D printed anatomical models will play a key role in patient education and radiology outreach, in addition to complementing the art and science of surgery. In addition to implementing new technologies, I aim to contribute to their advancement.

                One of my strongest interests lies in the development of medical devices and other tools to advance innovation in radiology and related fields. I anticipate engineering and design projects within this realm to be an integral part of my career. As I go throughout each day, I observe problems or inefficiencies and think about possible solutions. After considering the related issues and studying up on the topic, I begin designing and building prototypes. I have recently recognized the importance of intellectual property and business acumen for the successful production of new devices; this has led to my filing of two provisional patents and learning about the various aspects of starting a business prior to discussing licensing agreements. I hope to train at a program where such innovation is appreciated and encouraged, as I am confident it can profoundly benefit patients.

                In addition to device design, I am eager to assist in furthering imaging diagnostic methods and the treatment of patients. I observed first-hand the prolonging of my father’s life through surgical and medical therapy advances informed by MRI and CT scans. His illness, remission, and subsequent death expanded my perspective on life, its fragility, and the need for skilled healthcare professionals. The physicians who treated him extended his life which afforded him, and the rest of our family, joy and contentment. The opportunity to make such an impact in the lives of patients buttresses my motivation to become a radiologist. Improving and extending a life enables a person to play the carillon, spend time with grandchildren, or do whatever brings a sense of fulfillment in the best health possible. I look forward to the great honor of contributing to this process.
